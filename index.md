## Welcome to Openedit!

A work in progress piece of software, or piece(S) of code? I don't know, anyways here we go!

Want to make videos for YouTube or TikTok but have no idea how to edit them? You don't need to with Openedit! It does ALL the editing for you so you don't need to do ANYTHING! And kids normally have TROUBLE editing, and when they finish the video they are making that took like a week to edit for the child, and they get hate comments like "Bad video, disliking!", that may make the child sad! Not with Openedit! Openedit trys to make videos as DECENT AS POSSIBLE, so you can make some at least a little bit of decent content with LITERALLY no effort AT ALL! And the child will get good comments like, "Great video! Subscribed!" and that will make the child feel good!

### PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE!

So, a batch file to start the OEPL (OpeneditProgrammingLanguage) will be made soon and can be used to run Openedit modes quickly through automations.

It's very simple.

To start the programming language you need to have Openedit installed and you need to start the cd command to direct to the main program. The batch file coming soon will do this for you.

So, open your local terminal, and type in,

`cd (your folder where you installed openedit)`

OK, after that, you have started OEPL.

Check FFmpeg version by typing in,

`start ffvd.bat`

So, to clip a video, use,

`start openeditclip.bat`

To compress a video, use

`start openeditcompresser.bat`

To mix a video, use

`start openeditmixer.bat`

Bla, bla bla, you get it.
